// Welcome to algorithmsðŸ¦„


// 1. I am going to Create a function called reverse String
// 2. I am going to pass in the sting as an argument 
// 3. I am going to declaire a variable called stringSlice and set it equal to the string argument and use the builtin method .slice with two ("") inside
// 4. This creates a new array with every element of the string divided 
// 7. I am going to declair a new variable called reversed and set it equal to an empty array 
// 5. Now I am going to use the built in method .map on the stringSlice array
// 6. The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
// 8. Within the .map method I am going to .unshift every element of the array into the newly made reversed array.
// 9. I am going to return the reversed array after I use the .join method in order to make it back into a string



const reverseString = (string) => {
  let stringSlice = string.slice("")
  stringSlice.map(letter => {
    
  })

}








console.log(reverseString("LOKI"))
